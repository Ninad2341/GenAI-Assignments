            "The events of September 11, 2001, commonly referred to as 9/11, were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda on the United States. Here’s a summary of what happened:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **The Attacks**:\n",
            "   - **First Plane (American Airlines Flight 11)**: At 8:46 a.m. EDT, a Boeing 767 crashed into the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center in New York City.\n",
            "   - **Second Plane (United Airlines Flight 175)**: At 9:03 a.m. EDT, a second Boeing 767 crashed into the South Tower (Tower 2) of the World Trade Center.\n",
            "   - **Third Plane (American Airlines Flight 77)**: At 9:37 a.m. EDT, a Boeing 757 crashed into the western side of the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, leading to a partial collapse of the building.\n",
            "   - **Fourth Plane (United Airlines Flight 93)**: At 10:03 a.m. EDT, a fourth Boeing 757 crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Passengers on this flight had learned about the previous attacks and attempted to retake control of the plane from the hijackers, leading to its crash before it could reach its intended target, believed to be either the U.S. Capitol or the White House.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Collapse of the World Trade Center**:\n",
            "   - The South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m. EDT, just 56 minutes after being struck.\n",
            "   - The North Tower collapsed at 10:28 a.m. EDT, 1 hour and 42 minutes after being struck.\n",
            "   - A third building, 7 World Trade Center, collapsed later that day at 5:21 p.m. EDT due to fires and structural damage.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Casualties**:\n",
            "   - **Total Deaths**: 2,977 fatalities, excluding the 19 hijackers.\n",
            "   - **World Trade Center**: 2,753 deaths, including 343 firefighters and 71 law enforcement officers.\n",
            "   - **Pentagon**: 184 deaths.\n",
            "   - **Flight 93**: 40 deaths (including the 4 hijackers).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Response**:\n",
            "   - **Immediate Response**: Emergency services, including firefighters, police officers, and paramedics, responded immediately to the scenes, with many making heroic efforts to save lives.\n",
            "   - **National Response**: President George W. Bush addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 8:30 p.m. EDT, condemning the attacks and vowing a strong response. The U.S. government launched a massive investigation and began preparations for military action against al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden.\n",
            "   - **Global Response**: The attacks were widely condemned by governments and international organizations around the world. NATO invoked Article 5 of its charter for the first time, declaring the attacks to be an attack against all NATO members.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Aftermath**:\n",
            "   - **War on Terror**: The U.S. and its allies launched the \"War on Terror,\" beginning with the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 to dismantle al-Qaeda and remove the Taliban regime, which had harbored al-Qaeda.\n",
            "   - **Homeland Security**: The Department of Homeland Security was created to coordinate domestic anti-terrorism efforts.\n",
            "   - **Memorials and Rebuilding**: Memorials were established at the sites of the attacks, including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center site. The One World Trade Center was built as part of the rebuilding effort.\n",
            "\n",
            "9/11 had profound impacts on global politics, security measures, and societal attitudes, shaping the course of the 21st century.\n"
